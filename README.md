### Description
It's sample of the isomorphic application, than I builded with the Express and React.
It has a lot of benefits:
- The most basic is that it is available as a SPA and also available for the search bots without additional investments!
- The same application can be developed in a way that will work fine even without JS on the client, for example, there was a network error, an error in the code, etc .. Perfect for enterprise projects, when every client is important!
